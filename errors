Error Productions:-
1.) else without previous if




Problems with grammar:-
1.) if we are not supporting classes in classes, then we should remove it from constant declarations as well

2.) http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5142349/declare-a-const-array
	This says we cannot declare constant(handled at complile time) arrays, we have to declare them as readonly(handled at runtime). Arrays are objects so they are created only at runtime.
	Line-39
3.) we need to keep static as well, since without it we cannot use class members with some other class meber.
	eg- class HelloWorld
	{
    	public int[] Titles = {4,3,2};
    	void Main()
    	{
    		Titles[0]=3;
    	}
	}
	so we might need multiple modifiers as well. static public 

	We should support readonly as well, it allows access to members from some ther class but only a readonly access. 

4.) dim-separators are actually array of arrays constant initializers.
