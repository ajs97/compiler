NOTE: For blocks, braces required for single statement as well.
1.) Language Features :-
    a.) Data Types - int,bool,string(of size < 200),arrays,objects
    b.) Operators
            For int:
            - Unary -> !,-,~,+
            - Relational ->  <, >, <=, >=, ==, !=
            - Arithmetic -> +,-,/,%
            - Bitwise -> <<,>>,&,|,^
            - Logical ops -> &&,||
            - Assignment -> =,+=,-=,*=,/=,%=,^=,&=,|= (only work for identifiers,not member/element access)
            For bool:
            - Unary-> !
            - Logical -> &&,||
            - Assignment -> =
            Objects:
            - Assignment -> = (copies data of object)
    c.) Loops -> for, while, do-while
    d.) Selection statements -> if-else, switch
    e.) Jump statements -> return, continue, break
    f.) Arrays -> 1-D of types - {int,bool}
    g.) Classes
        - Inheritence (from a chain of parents as well)
        - Exactly one class must have a function Main(), this class does not have variables as class members(only methods allowed although method may have any variables/arrays/objects)
        - scope modifiers- {public,private} for data members of class only(not functions)
    h.) Functions
        - Allowed return types -> int,bool,void
        - Allowed arguement types -> int,bool,objects, (no arrays)
        - Return statements supported within blocks as well;garbage/void value returned if no return statement according to return type
